PURPOSE: 
In week five of my Codetalk bootcamp program I was assigned to build a website for a client based on what they wanted the topic, color, and title to be. After I had to draw inspiration from things I found relevent, then skecthed out 3 prototypes of these websites. Below you will find some of the requirements my client wanted.

CLIENT REQUIREMENTS:

Topic: Candles

Title: The Queen of Candles

Two Fonts: Lora(cyreal)
  
*Notes: My client wants to use Lora (cyreal) as a possible header because it is simple and she liked the serif design. My   client also wanted to use quicksand because it is very spacious, large and tiny. She would like to use this as the possible paragraph.

*Notes: My client said she wanted to use the color beige, chocolate brown to go with the candle website design. She said she likes these colors because it is very soothing to look at. 

INSPORATION: The first website I found was from the Larchmount Sanctuary Spa company, the reason why I like this website is because it has the chocolatey colors my client wanted to have. I like that it looks soft and rich in colors and the defines the relaxing environment my client wants for her candles webpage. Also, the second website I found was from Liz Angeles Wellness center. It is also another spa service company that has a nice moving picture as a background, and text over it in the header. I chose this website because I want to try to imitate it. 

DESIGN CONCEPT: I want to use the design principle of continuity to draw the attention of the viewer, and use closure to show an image of a candle possibly in the background.
